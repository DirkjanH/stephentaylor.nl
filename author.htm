<h3>Stephen Taylor
</h3>
<div id="lange_tekst">
  <p>Stephen  Taylor (1950) began his musical career at the age of ten as a chorister at  Bristol Cathedral (UK). On leaving school he ventured to the Netherlands in  1969 for organ lessons with Ewald Kooiman, to whom he returned intermittently  while reading music at Oxford, where he was Organ Scholar of Jesus College and  was tutored by John Caldwell, James Dalton and Frank Ll. Harrison. He continued  his organ studies in the Netherlands, where, taught by Nico van der Hooven and  Jan Welmers at the Utrecht Conservatory, he won the Sweelinck Prize of  Amsterdam (1975) and was awarded the Prix d'Excellence (1978). <br>
    For  more than twenty years Stephen Taylor was organist of the Nicola√Økerk in  Utrecht, where he organised many out-of-the-box concerts with and without organ.  In 2006 he was awarded the St Martin Medal for his services to the cultural  life of the city. As chairman of the artistic council of the International  Haarlem Organ Festival he was closely involved in the festival editions of  2010, '12 and '14, and the publication in 2014 of the 50th anniversary volume <em>The Haarlem Essays</em>. <br>
    Stephen  Taylor has been active as a musician, teacher, author and translator. He has given  recitals in many parts of Europe and has played continuo with prominent Dutch  and Flemish early music groups. His <u><a href="publications.htm">publications</a></u> in English and Dutch include  studies of twentieth-century organ building, organ music and performance. His <u><a href="translations.htm">translations</a></u> from Dutch and German on music and cultural history have appeared in leading  journals and have been issued by prominent publishing houses.</p>
