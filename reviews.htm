<h3>Reviews of <em>The  Lost Chord</em></h3>
<div id="lange_tekst">
  <p><em>What  makes this tutor special is the didactic and methodical concept ... Taylor does  justice to his claim. The book is clear and easy to use for a player with  sufficient keyboard ability.</em> (De Orgelvriend, the  Netherlands)</p>
  <p><em>A  notable aspect is that explanation of the theory is accompanied by  clarification of its musical significance. That is not always the case in books  on music theory ... Those who wish to know why certain harmonic progressions  sound healthy and others do not, and those who perhaps dream of composing  something themselves, can benefit greatly from this book.</em> (Akkoord, the Netherlands)</p>
  <p><em>The  Lost Chord is <u>the</u> way for all amateur organists and student organists to  master the harmonisation of hymns and other melodies. Highly recommended!</em> (Het Orgel, the Netherlands)</p>
  <p><em>One  would really wish that every conservatory student should have the opportunity  to explore harmonisation à la Taylor ... It is a fact that many a student is  familiar with all sorts of altered chords while still not able to harmonise a  simple melody well ... The book contains many separate cadence and sequence exercises and  frequent transpositions; in the meantime the user also becomes proficient in  basso continuo and simple improvisations based on harmonic schemes ... I am convinced that this multiform  approach is excellent ... For conservatory students it would be an ideal  preparation for their main course.</em> (Dutch Journal of Music Theory)</p>
  <p><em>A particular strength is that the many exercises give  a feel for using certain chords in different ways; it is not teaching by theory  alone but by musical practice ... It is a highly recommended tutor.</em> (Sunday by Sunday, Royal School of Church Music, UK)</p>
  <p> <em>'It is for the player to embark on a voyage of discovery, and for the  teacher to offer guidance.' This single sentence from Stephen Taylor's superb  new textbook (the sentiment expressed might almost be from Schumann's Musical Rules for the Young)  encapsulates the refreshingly encouraging approach of this excellent new  primer. Keyboard harmony only becomes the Very Difficult Thing which so many  players perceive it to be when it's divorced from the continuum of musical  thought and practice of which it forms an entirely natural part. The Lost Chord – with its roots  firmly planted in the Dutch tradition of improvisation in the liturgy – adopts  an admirably pragmatic approach to skills which too often become obscured in  theorising ... </em><br>
    <em>At every step, pertinent examples (largely drawn from familiar hymnody)  reinforce the principles under discussion, fully supported by cogent written  explanations and helpful cross-referencing to material already covered ...A  particularly impressive aspect ... is the way in which the student is encouraged  to analyse the aural effect of given progressions and procedures ... </em><br>
    <em>The sense of natural progression continues in the final volume.  Developing concepts of figuration, more complex modulation schemes, and  introducing passing and auxiliary notes lead the student towards more  sophisticated realisations of material from earlier volumes – an entirely  logical recapitulation, which will reinforce a sense of progress and  achievement. Schumann said: 'Theory, thorough bass, counterpoint etc will meet  you friendly enough, if you meet them so.' And so will harmonisation. This new  tutor makes a fundamental keyboard skill as friendly as it could possibly be,  and everyone concerned with teaching keyboard harmony at any level will find it  an entirely worthwhile – not to say thought-provoking – investment.</em> (Choir &amp; Organ, UK)</p>
  <p><em>The text is very clear, well laid out and easy to  follow ... the many exercises allow the user plenty of opportunity to develop  and write down his or her own creative solutions. In my opinion The Lost Chord  does an excellent job of bridging the chasm between head knowledge of harmonies  etc ... and the frequent inability [of organ students] to improvise anything  other than a passing-note or two in the bass line of a well-known hymn. I look forward  to making use of this excellent resource with some of my own students at Sydney  Conservatorium of Music in the very near future.</em> (Journal  of the Organ Music Society of Sydney, Australia). </p>
